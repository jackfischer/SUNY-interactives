Where to apply to college is on any high school student's mind, especially as siblings and friends begin to return at the end of the summer. However, as you weigh SAT scores, prices and campuses, there's one factor that's often overlooked: how many students who set foot on a campus actually graduate.

Luckily, SUNY leads the way in this metric. If you're considering a SUNY campus, whether it's community college, a technical school, or one of the four university centers, keep in mind that SUNY students are often better off when trying to graduate:



While graduating is an important symbolic step, it also has serious implications for your career: people with college degrees tend to have better salaries and across the board have less unemployment than those with just a high school diploma.

With the cost of college on everyone's mind, it's also important to graduate on time to help manage the cost of your education and any debt you might have after. SUNY helps students stay on track and get ahead of the competition from other universities across the country.
